# My Token Documentation
The Token Smart Contract s a beginner-friendly template that helps developers create their own digital tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Whether you're new to blockchain development or looking for a starting point to understand how tokens work, this contract provides a simple structure for minting (creating) and burning (destroying) tokens. It's a friendly introduction to the world of decentralized finance and custom token creation for beginners in blockchain development.

## Getting Started

### Using [Remix-IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)

**step 1**: Open your web browser and go to the [Remix-IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)

**Step 2** - Create a new file in the contract folder and name it, do not forget the suffix .sol to identify it as a solidity contract.

    ```
    token.sol
    ```

**Step 3** - Navigate to the myToken.sol on this github page. Copy and paste the contents of the myToken.sol in your newly created file on [Remix-IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

**Step 4** - Run and Test on  [Remix-IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) locally, using provided addresses. 

- Switch to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab.

- Click the "Deploy" button to deploy the contract to the Ethereum blockchain.

**NOTE:** Provide neccessary parameters for the contructor to initialize the state of the contract.
